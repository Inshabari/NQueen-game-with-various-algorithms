# NQueen-game-with-various-algorithms
This is a fun interactive game that uses the concept of N Queen problem. It finds solution according to the board size given by the user themselves. The solutions it generates can be according to the algorithm of user's choice. The algorithms currently encoded to be used are BFS, DFS, Recursive-Backtracking and NQueenSolver(my own custom algo)
